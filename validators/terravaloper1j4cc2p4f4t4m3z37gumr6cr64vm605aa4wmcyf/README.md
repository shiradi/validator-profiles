# Moon Platoon
### _**“Making sure your votes count while earning you sweet staking rewards”**_

Moon Platoon was created out of the dust of Luna Classic. We weren't pleased with how many investors who bought post de-peg weren't allowed to vote. We want to make sure that all Luna holders have a voice in the future of the Luna ecosystem.

Our Goals:
* To earn you the most rewards while maintaining high validator node integrity
* To make sure our delegators and the larger Luna community as a whole, are heard through governance
* To focus soley on the Luna project and advancing the ecosystem

We will also donate 1% of our earnings per year to either Angel Protocol, the community pool, or dev's looking to get their projects off the ground.
We believe that we can help our delegators earn more by advancing Luna and the ecosystem as a whole. Donating to these commmunities helps with that.
